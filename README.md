# Game Marketplace

## Project Overview
This project is a **Game Marketplace** platform that connects game sellers with buyers. The platform has two distinct user views: **Admin View** and **Sellers View**. Sellers can list, update, and manage their games, while admins have control over user registrations, review approvals, and overall platform moderation.

## Features
### Admin View
- **Seller Registrations Management**: Admins can view and approve or deny seller registration requests after email verification.
- **Review Moderation**: Admins can see submitted comments (reviews) for sellers from anonymous users and decide whether to approve or reject them.
- **Seller and Review Management**: Admins can see specific registered users (approved sellers) and view the reviews that have already been approved for those sellers.

### Sellers View
- **Game Management**:
  - Add new games to the platform.
  - Update game details (title, description, price, photo etc.).
  - Remove games from their listing.

### General Features
- **Main Page (Index)**:
  - Displays the **Top 5 Rated Sellers**, determined by the highest-rated (Average) approved reviews.
  - Enables users to **search for game objects** based on title and also filter by Seller Rating.
  - Allows users to view all games listed by a specific seller.
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Users must **register and confirm their email** via a verification link sent to their inbox.
  - Admins must **approve or deny** new seller registration requests.
  - Approved sellers can sign in and manage their profiles.
  - Users can **reset their passwords** via an email reset link if needed.
- **Profile Page**:
  - Sellers can **view reviews** written about them.
  - Sellers can **change their password** securely.
  - Sellers can **list and manage all their uploaded games**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Email Sending
To enable email functionality for account verification and password recovery, set up email credentials in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.mail.username=your-email@example.com
spring.mail.password=your-email-password
```

### 2. Set Up File Upload Directory
Create a folder on your system where uploaded game objects will be stored.(folder is generated for each seller, which includes 2 folder - Images for game obejct and Profile - for profile photo) Then, define this directory in `application.properties`:
```properties
file.upload-dir=/path/to/upload-directory
```

### 3. Set Up MySQL Database with Docker
The project uses **MySQL** as the database, running inside a **Docker container**. To set it up, ensure **Docker** is installed and running,got to root directory of this project  then execute:
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This will automatically pull and start a MySQL container with the required configuration.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** - Backend framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security** - Handles authentication and authorization with JWT.
- **MySQL** - Relational database for storing game data, users, and reviews.
- **Docker** - Used to containerize the MySQL database for easy setup and deployment.
- **Spring Mail** - Handles email verification and password reset emails.
- **Spring Data JPA** - Simplifies database interactions with repositories.
- **React** - Frontend github link - https://github.com/tugushigiorgi/RatingAppFrontend.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tugushigiorgi/RatingSystemREST.git
   cd RatingSystemRest
   ```
2. **Configure `application.properties`** with your email settings, file storage path, and database connection details.
3. **Start the MySQL database container**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
4. **Access the application** in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
